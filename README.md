# Door-automation-using-PIR-and-Servo-Motor

The goal of this project is to design and implement a door automation system using a PIR sensor, servo motor, and Raspberry Pi Pico. The system will automatically open and close the door based on human presence detected by the PIR sensor.In today’s rapidly evolving technological landscape, automation has become a cornerstone of modern living. Automated systems not only enhance convenience but also improve security and efficiency in residential andcommercial environments. Among these advancements, door automation
systems play a critical role in facilitating seamless access control, offering both functionality and sophistication.
This project focuses on developing a door automation system that utilizes a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor to detect motion and a servo motor to control the door's movement. The system is designed to automatically open the door when motion is detected near it and close it after a predefined time.
The entire process is orchestrated using the Raspberry Pi Pico, a versatile and cost-effective microcontroller that provides the necessary computational power and GPIO interfaces for this application.


The door automation system was successfully implemented and tested, achieving the desired functionality of automatic door operation based on motion detection. Below are the detailed results and observations:
1. System Performance
• Motion Detection:
o The PIR sensor reliably detected motion within a range of
approximately 5-7 meters.
o The response time was instantaneous, ensuring quick door operation
upon detection.
• Door Movement:
o The servo motor operated smoothly, rotating to the specified angles
for opening and closing the door.
o The system responded accurately to multiple consecutive motion
events.
2. LED Indicators
• The green LED lit up correctly when the door was opening, providing a
clear visual indication.
• The red LED accurately indicated the door closing phase.
• The LEDs enhanced user feedback, confirming system actions.
